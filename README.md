# WebProject2
 For my project, I made a website that mimics a social media site, with fake posts about how you might present yourself on social media. There are a variety of "personas" are archetypal personalities on the Internet, and you can choose who you want to be with the freedom the Internet allows. The profile picture on my site is a Live Feed that allows the viewer to reflect on themselves, and make them feel exposed to the world, but through the Internet, they aren't exposed, and can choose how much to reveal about themselves. I also Included a button to change the background color, giving the user the ability to personalize their experience, and present a plethora of choices about who they can be on the Internet.
